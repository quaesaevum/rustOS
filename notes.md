# A Freestanding Rust Binary
Personal notes of Josiah on following Philipp Oppermann's blog "Writing an OS in Rust", located at https://os.phil-opp.com/

03 Sept 2020:
- Completed *A Freestanding Rust Binary*. Got everything working so far.

05 Sept 2020:
- Started *A Minimal Rust Kernel*
- Completed it as well
Thoughts:  
- Basic setup.
- Covers BIOS but not UEFI at this time.
- Do we run on QEMU to avoid damaging our own system?
- Could this run on a Pi? On an Arduino?
- How could this work on IoT devices?
